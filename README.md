# Naruto carousel

This project is a simple carousel with some picture from Naruto. Also you can hit the like button if you likes the picture! Our carousel should allow the user to click the backwards or forwards button to go to the previous or next image.

The images will be stored in a simple array. We will see how to use state in order to store the current image. Then we will update that state to go to the previous or next image, according to the button the user pressed. If you are in the first or last image, you need to go forward or back because the arrow disappear. All depends of your position.

NOTES: Pictures come from Pinteret.
